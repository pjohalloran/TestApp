TestApp
=======

A empty application ready for linking with the gameframework library.
Use a clean starting point for creating applications that use the
gameframework library.

Clone the gameframework repository and clone this project as a git sub module
inside the gameframework/src directory.  You will need to create a premake
project file to generate a solution.
Hint: Copy Pool3D inside gameframework/projects/premake.lua

Build and run.
